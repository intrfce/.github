# Intrfce - Laravel (+more) Packages.

Intrfce is the namespace for packages from Dan Matthews - ([@danmatthews](https://github.com/danmatthews)).

## Packages

### [Laravel Frontend Enums](https://github.com/intrfce/laravel-frontend-enums)

A package to publish + sync your PHP enums to the frontend to avoid magic string or number comparisons.

```
composer require intrfce/laravel-frontend-enums
```

### [Enum Attribute Descriptors](https://github.com/intrfce/enum-attribute-descriptors)

A package to allow you to declare a readable title and description for your enum cases with PHP attributes.

```
composer require intrfce/enum-attribute-descriptors
```

## Why "Intrfce"?

I'm a full stack developer, so i work across both the front and back-end of applications, mostly in Laravel, Svelte, Vue and Laravel Livewire.

Intrfce represents the commonality between both - server side code has an "interface" in a number of ways - API's, Interface classes etc. The frontend has an "Interface" in the more traditional sense - a UI layer.

Plus, it's short, punchy, memorable, and i took a few vowels out so we've really got that 2000s-era Web 2.0 vibe.
